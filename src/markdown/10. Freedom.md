## Helping Others?
As explained earlier, you no longer need to care about "nofap" and related things. We are inclined by society to help everybody else but not ourselves. However, if you want to help the cause of others using ppmo, say something like this: "ppmo helped me gain an understanding" if it did so. Do not say, "You should read this guide. It's a perfect how-to". It would be a crime to prescriptionize or recommend. Curiosity will always work the best. You no longer need to consume content around nofap, and no longer have to have endless conversations about it because you are free.

## Note From Author
With an inclination, and belief in a desire, you can achieve anything. Go and get it. I Love you all. Btw do not underestimate books.

"Truth lies not in Teaching,
But in the desire to learn. 
Truth lies not in learning information,
But in learning The Truth.

Learning The Truth
Lies in a consistent exposure to a Source of Truth.
A consistent exposure to a Source of Truth
Arises from a longing for Truth."

## Groups
There are no groups for ppmo. This is on purpose - there is no need for any.
If you want to submit an improvement for the site or spelling (not the book itself), then hit up the repo linked (somewhere I hope).
