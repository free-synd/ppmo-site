## Helping Others?
As explained earlier, you no longer need to care about "nofap" and things related. We are inclined by society to help everybody else but not ourselves. However, if you want to help the cause others using ppmo, say something like this: "ppmo helped me gain an understanding" if it did so. Do not say "you should read this guide its a perfect how-to". It would be a crime to prescriptionize, or recommend. Curiosity will always work the best. You not longer need to consume content around nofap, no longer have to have endless conversations about it. Because you are free.

## Groups
There are no groups for ppmo. This is on purpose - there is no need.
If you want to submit an improvement for the site or spelling (not the book itself), then hit up the repo linked (somewhere I hope).
