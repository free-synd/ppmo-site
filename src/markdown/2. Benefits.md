Leaving PMO provides many benefits and positives, as detailed in the introduction. These positives come from the changes in our neurochemistry and also our ability to control our reaction to emotions. However, technically, leaving PMO has no positives - it is just the removal of negatives.

When someone stops having a flu, they do not think that stopping having a flu had great benefits. Instead, they understand that it is an end of negatives - the flu was the cause of the grievence - you would not purposely get a flu just to feel the relief of it leaving again. PMO is the same way. We do not notice this, as the changes are slow and gradual, but porn has ever increasing negative and unproductive effects on our lives, as dopamine desensetization requires us to up our usage and compulsion. Therefore, when leaving these negatives, we can expect marvellous changes and improvements in our lives and outlook.

Do not make the mistake of normalizing masturbation. Because we have done it for so long, we find it hard to relate to when we didn't, and most use language to suggest benefits or that leaving PMO is not the normal. While in a societal sense, it may be the 'norm', in a bodily sense, it is not natural. Naturally, nobody has urges to watch lewd video clips as a reaction to emotion. Naturally, nobody tries to escape anxiety and fear by tricking our bodies into connections to partners we will never know. Porn is not natural and never will be. Masturbation too, has been around for a while, but on its own, it still drains your energy, and is just another outlet of hypersexualization.

Therefore make this key understanding - **The benefits of nofap are not direct benefits, but are just the end of negatives.**

## Neurochemical Changes Through PMO And MO
Any doubt of the negatives come from the nature of addiction. It happens slowly. If in one day, you went back to what you felt like before you started, the difference would be more apparent. This is the 'boiling frog' analogy.

PMO is ... 

## Intro To Brainwashing
Brainwashing seems like a strong word, but once you realize the scope of PMO and how much it is promoted, you will understand that the word is appropriate.

Understanding brainwashing requires us to first examine the powerful effects of supernormal stimulus. Our brains are simply are not prepared for the existence of an 'online harem', allowing us to flick through more potential mates in fifteen minutes than our ancestors had in several lifetimes.

There's been much misguided advice and scare tactics in the past (like the saying that masturbation will make you blind) that really overdid it. Misconceptions like these were right to be ignored, but in the process, the baby has been thrown out with the bath water. From our earliest years, our subconcious minds are bombarded by sexual messages and imagery, in all types of media, loaded with induendo. At it's core, the fundemental message implied is that "sex and sexual gratification is the most precious thing on this earth". It may seem ridiculuous, but think about the end of most films or TV shows. Think about the popular hip-hop and rap videos of our time. Think about the advertisements and society as a whole. They perpetuate this idea, that instead of love, bodily gratification is the most important desire you should hold. This impact does not register in our concious minds, but our subconcious mind absorbs it and builds pathways based upon it.

## Scientific Reasoning
There are a whole host of publicity in the other direction, supporting the fact that using porn and masturbation has detrimental effects on your health and wellbeing. There are detailed and reviewed studies on the effects of porn (such as YourBrainOnPorn) and other internet subcultures, however, these are not enough to rid the mind of the brainwashing, and they are never enough reasoning to make the user quit.

**This is because your brain does not care about negatives when it is in a reactionary state; it reacts to emotions through the pathways you have used the most.**

You would think that in knowledge of all the negatives that PMO provides, including depression, anxiety, PIED, and others, that it would be easy to quit. But then thinking about it, for other aspects in our lives, just knowing the negatives of an action is not enough to quit. A lot of us consume high sugar foods and unhealthy foods in ful knowledge of it's destructive nature. A lot of us use alcohol or drugs, and perform other harmful activities in full knowledge of their nature. **The reason we keep using in knowledge of negatives is lack of mental control to emotions.**
