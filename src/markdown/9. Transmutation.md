## Shifting Energy
You can take back energy that was previously robbed from you. The same energy that flows through every cell in your body, and the same energy that communicates with the ether. This energy on its own is nothing but a potential. This potential must be harnessed to be useful. Such energy creates a sense of depth in ones self. On the contrary, those with a lack of this aura appear with a lack of presence and depth. Energy is life, and in the lack of it, you have had less potential.

You must spend coins for them to be useful, and energy is the same. Coins in a sense, are just another way of transferring energy, as is everything.

This concept is not some abstract idea. This is purely the nature of the universe and life.

## Boredom
When a user becomes free they normally have much more time available to do things. This is because #1 They have come to realize the emptiness and pointlessness of some of the previous activities. #2 They no longer need to browse through material to try to get dopamine. #3 They develop a greater attraction to smaller, but more fufilling tasks.

This is a great thing. It is time which has not been utilized previously. It is your decision with what to do with your time - and also with what to do to work towards your inner life inclination. However, I have a couple recommendations.

I personally believe a good idea is finding something fun or relaxing that you gravitate towards naturally. For more productive periods, I believe it may be beneficial to define something you love to to that is also productive. Having both something to do when you are attentive/focused and something to do when relaxing (that is not too artifical/empty) may be of benefit to you.

In general, you should not aim to be perfect. Aim to be **better**. That is what matters. This does not mean you should not have high aspirations, but avoid comparing yourself to some "perfect" version of yourself which does not even exist.

When you fill in your time, it is wise to follow principles outlined in this guide that can also be applied to other goals. Make what you want to do the easiest option and make what you don't want to do the option that is least attractive. 

## Substitutes
Sometimes, people that leave pmo feel an inclination to substitute pmo with other things/bad habits. This only happens due to a fear. A fear of losing dopamine, even though after the anticipation we come to a realization that we were fooled.

There is no need to replace PMO with anything. Freedom requires no substitutes.

## Power
When we identify negative thinking patterns in motion, we can make the realization that we are actively building up positive neural pathways that increase our ability to control and make less impulsive decisions.

When this is not done, you are creating pain for yourself, by not paying attention to your schemas. Act *greater*, as we have the power and the ablity to take the wheel of our reactions.

## Curiosity Questions
Some of you may not understand why curiosity questions are bad. As hey, it is natural for us to ask questions about things to we can increase our intelligence, and this is the way we learn new things. So what is the problem here?

When I talk about curiosity questions, I am talking about questions that have no real purpose except for changing emotions. Questions relating to when things are happening, how much of something will change, how many benefits will happen, how long you have to wait, is this a bad sign, etc.

These types of questions serve no real purpose except for increasing anticipation or anxiety. Some may say that both anticipation and anxiety are the same emotion, but with a positive or negative connetation attached. The issue with these questions is that is does just this - it makes us worry for little reason except for our curiosity.

It is in our nature to wait for things, to constantly ask when a parcel is coming, to ask how long some process wil take. The reality of these questions is that no matter how many questions you ask, the processes will stay the same.

In relation to PMO, you may want to ask these questions because you are anticipating something, or you may ask these questions becoming anxious if something is good or bad or blah blah blah.

You have to realize that the only change these curiosity questions will make will be an undesirable and unproductive outcome - the emotions will feed right back into the neural pathways of PMO.

True peace and freedom lies in the understanding that you do not have to worry as soon as the process is under way. You do not have to wait for freedom. You do not have to wait for peace. You should feel no need to ask such questions, because the process in under way and freedom is already yours through understanding.

## Reminders
At certain times you will be reminded about PMO. Through social media, through thoughts, when you may be bored and so on.

Some people really dislike the thought of this. They begin to fear the worst, like it is some sort of bad sign that they are going to fail soon. This is just again, the trap of classifying things as good and bad.

When reminders occur naturally, it presents an opportunity. It is a moment in time where peace and freedom can be acknowledged. Over time, the old pathways will weaken, and your new natural will be peace. However, there is no reason to wait for anything. You can experience freedom in motion, at all times.

Internal reminders are just remenants of the previous lifestyle that accounted for PMO. These are simply associations we made that incited us in the past to go on the chase for that glimpse of freedom, but never being able to reach it. Peace comes when you realize you can stop chasing.

Of course, you do not want to intentionally set up reminders. This ties in to the lifestyle change that was talked about earlier. You may want to unfollow some social media pages, leave some communities with a negative influence, and you may even want to change where you take your phone, and things like that. Do not feel forced to do any of these things, however, I am advising to change such lifestyle activities, so PMO no longer fits in anywhere in the picture.
