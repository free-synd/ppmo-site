### Important Note From The Author
Regardless of what you have read previously, read every word with humility and sincerity.

Compare the words to your real life experiences. Challenge them. Do not continue without resolve.

The process is no mechanical thing. You can use no formula, but instead must seek understanding.

**We are seeking truth.**

Do not believe the words that follow in this book. Instead, find the truth within them.

Belief does not encourage freedom. Because belief is subjective. Truth is universal.

**Change your focus from methods and guides to understanding truth.**

With that said, my heart goes out to all of you.

I hope this book is of benefit.
