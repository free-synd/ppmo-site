You can check out the settings on the side tab if you want to customize how the site looks when you are reading (but don't go too crazy with customization).

Also, each chapter has a button to let you mark it as complete.
You can also read this book on mobile or on desktop.
After marking the chapter as complete, you can progress to the next chapter. Try it for this chapter.
